# Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! If you know of a company that has an easy application process please open up a pull request to add it to the list. Some things to keep in mind:

* Be sure to include a link to the company's main career page.
* Maintain alphabetical order.
* For location add each city that they company is hiring software engineers for. Cities should be separated by a semicolon and in alphabetical order.
* If the company hires remote employees include that under location.

It's alright for a single commit to have multiple companies.
