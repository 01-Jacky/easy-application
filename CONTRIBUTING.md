# Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! If you know of a company that has an easy application process please open up a pull request to add it to the list. Be sure to include a link to the company's main career page (e.g. https://www.beepi.com/careers/teams rather than https://jobs.lever.co/beepi) and ensure you maintain alphabetical order. It's alright for a single commit to have multiple companies.
